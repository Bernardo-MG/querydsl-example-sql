# Querydsl Example with SQL

Using the Querydsl DSL to handle SQL queries. These queries are handled through the tests.

[![Development docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-develop-blue.svg)][site-develop]

## Database support

Three databases are used to test the queries:

- h2
- Mysql
- Postgres

These, except for h2, should be started before running the tests. Which can be done with Docker:

```
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml --project-name querydsl-example-sql up
```

## Running the queries

There is a profile for each database:

- h2
- mysql
- postgres

Just run the tests with the profile desired:

```
mvn clean verify -Pmysql
```

## Features

- SQL queries with Querydsl

## Documentation

Documentation is always generated for the latest release, kept in the 'master' branch:

- The [latest release documentation page][site-release].

Documentation is also generated from the latest snapshot, taken from the 'develop' branch:

- The [latest snapshot documentation page][site-develop].

The documentation site is actually a Maven site, and its sources are included in the project. If required it can be generated by using the following Maven command:

```
mvn verify site
```

The verify phase is required, otherwise some of the reports won't be generated.
